                        <h1>John Hur</h1>
                        <p>
                            Born in Germany June 28, 1990, I began my crazy existence.
                            <br><br>
                            I worked in social services and counseling for about seven years. It was rewarding, but at the same time, it was very taxing. I am very grateful for the experience and lessons within the field.
                            I learned how to be more disciplines, how to be part of a team, how to learn, how to problem solve, and how to move forward.
                            <br><br>
                            I have always wanted to learn to code, and 2021, I made the first step towards becoming a full stack developer. I enrolled in Northwestern's coding full-stack bootcamp. I realized immediately this is where I belong.
                            It was challenging, but I pushed and developed, both my applications and my character as a coder. I could have been an average student, and coasted through the bootcamp in the middle. Instead, I joined a study group where my peers and friends pushed me, helped eliminate inadequacies, and provided support.
                            <br><br>
                            I am proud of my applications. I want to be able to continue to be proud of what I do. I want to create, grow, work with a great team, help grow a great team into a greater team, and I want to continue to move forward.
                            This is where I belong, and I'm just happy to be here.

                                <p>People are not great. Unfortunately, we usually have to share a whole apartment building with other people. That probably means we use the same laundry room. Wouldn't it be nice if you can reserve a laundry machine and avoid all your quirky neighbors. Now you can! With Dibs, you can make reservations for washing/drying machines. Gone are the days of seeing your floor in a pile next to the trash can. No more missing of a singular sock. Maybe the best way to co-exist is to avoid people altogether. Thank you, Dibs!</p>
