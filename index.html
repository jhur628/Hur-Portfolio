                        <h1>John Hur</h1>
                        <p>Born in Germany June 28, 1990, John "the Machine" Hur began his crazy existence.</p>
                        <p>John did not know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew two things: He wanted to help and create.</p>
                        <p>John helped by dabbling in social work, working in nursing homes and residential treatment centers for traumatized youths. John helped both the old and the young.</p>
                        <p>John loved creating. John wrote sophomorically. John sang horribly. John danced befuddlingly. And recently, John coded.</p>
                        <p>John will continue to help and create, but he hopes to do so with the magic of coding!</p>
                        <p>HTML! CSS! JAVASCRIPT! NODE? All languages at his fingertips! Yet, he hungers for more.</p>

                                <p>Perhaps not as cool as Tour Baagii; however, a proud application deployed nonetheless. The Weather Dashboard is a web application that gives weather information based on what city the user submitted. The application used a open weather API to fetch weather data from different cities around the world. Is it cold? Is it hot? What's the UV index? What's the five day forecast? Find out using the Weather Dashboard Today!</p>
