                        <h1>John Hur</h1>
                        <p>Born in Germany June 28, 1990, John "the Machine" Hur began his crazy existence.</p>
                        <p>John did not know what he wanted to do with his life, but he knew two things: He wanted to help and create.</p>
                        <p>John helped by dabbling in social work, working in nursing homes and residential treatment centers for traumatized youths. John helped both the old and the young.</p>
                        <p>John loved creating. John wrote sophomorically. John sang horribly. John danced befuddlingly. And recently, John coded.</p>
                        <p>John will continue to help and create, but he hopes to do so with the magic of coding!</p>
                        <p>HTML! CSS! JAVASCRIPT! NODE! EXPRESS! SQL! All languages at his fingertips! Yet, he hungers for more.</p>

                                <p>People are not great. Unfortunately, we usually have to share a whole apartment building with other people. That probably means we use the same laundry room. Wouldn't it be nice if you can reserve a laundry machine and avoid all your quirky neighbors. Now you can! With Dibs, you can make reservations for washing/drying machines. Gone are the days of seeing your floor in a pile next to the trash can. No more missing of a singular sock. Maybe the best way to co-exist is to avoid people altogether. Thank you, Dibs!</p>
