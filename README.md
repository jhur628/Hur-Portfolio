# John's Updated Portfolio

## Description

I updated my portfolio once again.

Upon startup, the user is presented with five buttons. Each button is an element that will be displayed if clicked.

If the user clicks the "About Me" button, the About Me element will be displayed. If the "Work" button is pushed, the Work element will be displayed. If "Resume" is click, the Resume element is displayed. If "Links", then Links element. If "Contact Me", then Contact Me element.

If the user clicks the pictures of one of the works in "Work", the user is directed to a new tab with the deployed application.

I kept the the color scheme from my old portfolio as I really like gray. I used a font I found on Google Fonts, and it looks great.

I also made my portfolio mobile friendly, so it will be adapted to the tiny screans of smartphones.

As always, I had fun. I'm excited to do more, and I'm excited to see you tear my portfolio to pieces.

Thank you, and enjoy.
